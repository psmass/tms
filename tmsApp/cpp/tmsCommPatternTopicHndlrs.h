/*  This file is really an extension of the tmsCommsPattern.cxx and hold the
    Reader/Writer handlers that are dispatched from the comm patterns.  They are
    intended perform functions specific to individual topics (topic handers).  
    These functions are called with in the context of the thread processing a 
    particular pattern. 

    The signature and naming convention is:
        void TypeHandler_tms_TOPIC<TOPIC_NAME> (void);
        where Type Handler is: Reader, <Writer>, PeriodicWriter, and <OnChangeWriter>.

        Notes: 
        <Writer> typically will have no topics as it just sits or generic
        issues/events common to all non-periodic or non-OnChange writers. But if
        there was a reason to process those events specific to a topic then you would
        want to add handlers for generic Writers.

        <OnChangeWriter> seems generic enough not to need Topic specific handling.
        It simpley sends the topic pointed to and resets the trigger pointed to.
